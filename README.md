## What is Perfection?

Perfection is subjective, its definition changes for person to person. But, here perfection is Simplicity, Practicality and Accessiblity.

Simplicity - Solutions provided should be cost effective, simple to implement, learn and run.

Practicality - The given Solution must be practical for broader spectrum of stakeholders.

Accessibilty - Solutions should not be foreign looking, medium of communication is English and provide guides where necessary(it is highly apprecited).

Happy Tweaking.
